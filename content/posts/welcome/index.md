Hi there! Welcome to my new blog! ✨

I intend to write a bunch of things here like notes, guides or whatever.
I will also be using it as a replacement for my severely neglected Carrd-hosted portal that was linking people to my pages.

While this is a personal site, I hope you'll find something interesting in there. 💛

#### What's new compared to my previous Carrd-hosted site

That new setup has quite a few advantages from a visitor's point of view.

> - Blog area with articles that are open source[^1] 📰
> - Dark mode 🌚
> - Much faster loading speed / lighter on resources ⚡
> - Not affected by AWS downtimes 🔥 (lol)

And from my side, the changes are even more impactful.

> - No more scatered Notion pages that are impossible to find for others 📚
> - Text (Markdown) files as source for articles alike [Obsidian Publish][obsidian-publish] 📜
> - No more slow and clunky editor 🛠️
> - URLs that follow standards[^1] 🏷️
> - Open source software stack[^2] 🔍
> - No paid subscription specific to that site 💸
> - Sanity preserved ❤️‍🩹

In the end, we're all winning and I'm motivated again to maintain this website. 🏆

If you wanna do a Hugo website too, I recommend checking out [Christian Lampa's tutorial on Hugo][christianlampa-youtube-hugo] which has been the template for this website. 📺

Of course, feel free to check its source code and use it as inspiration for your own! ✨

In the meantime, go check out my socials or even my [Castopod instance][castopod]. 🎶

[^1]: Carrd doesn't actually use `/paths/` in web addresses for navigation, it has a [sections][carrd-docs-page] [(archive)][carrd-docs-page-archive] concept that uses `#ids` which is not really a standard way of doing even if it works.
[^2]: [Hugo][hugo-homepage] [(archive)][hugo-homepage-archive] is an [open source][hugo-github] static site generator written in Go.
