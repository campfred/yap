Hi there! Welcome to my new blog! ✨

I intend to write a bunch of things here like notes, guides or whatever.
I will also be using it as a replacement for my severely neglected Carrd-hosted portal that was linking people to my pages.

While this is a personal site, I hope you'll find something interesting in there. 💛

#### What's new compared to my previous Carrd-hosted site

That new setup has quite a few advantages from a visitor's point of view.

- Blog area with [articles that are open source][blog-github] 📰
- Dark mode 🌚
- Much faster loading speed / lighter on resources ⚡
- Not affected by AWS downtimes 🔥 (lol)

And from my side, the changes are even more impactful.

- No more scatered Notion pages that are impossible to find for others 📚
- Text (Markdown) files as source for articles (alike [Obsidian Publish][obsidian-publish] [<sup>(archive)</sup>][obsidian-publish-archive]) 📜
- No more slow and clunky editor 🛠️
- URLs that follow standards[^1] 🏷️
- Open source software stack[^2] 🔍
- Freedom of hosting platform 🚀
- No more subscription fees 💸
- Sanity preserved ❤️‍🩹

In the end, we're all winning and I'm motivated again to maintain this website. 🏆

If you wanna do a Hugo website too, I recommend checking out [Christian Lampa's tutorial on Hugo][christianlampa-youtube-hugo] which has been the template for this website. 📺

Of course, feel free to check its source code and use it as inspiration for your own! ✨

In the meantime, I wish you a nice day and hope to see you again soon!
Also, feel free to go check out [my socials](/) as I'll be posting my new articles there too and maybe even my [podcast "Listen with Camp"][castopod]. 🎶

[^1]: Carrd doesn't actually use `/paths/` in web addresses for navigation, it has a [sections][carrd-docs-page] [<sup>(archive)</sup>][carrd-docs-page-archive] concept that uses `#ids` which is not really a standard way of doing even if it works.
[^2]: [Hugo][hugo-homepage] [<sup>(archive)</sup>][hugo-homepage-archive] is an [open source][hugo-github] static site generator written in Go.
