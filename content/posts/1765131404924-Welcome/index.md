Hi there! Welcome to my new blog! ✨

I intend to write a bunch of things here like notes, guides or whatever while also using it as a replacement for my Carrd-hosted portal that was linking people to my things and was severely neglected.
While this is a personal site, I hope you'll find something interesting in there. 💛

#### What's new compared to my previous Carrd-hosted site

That new setup has quite a few advantages from a visitor's point of view.

- Blog area with articles that are open source[^1] 📰
- Dark mode 🌚
- Faster loading speed / lighter on resources ⚡
- URLs that follows standards with /paths/ for easy sharing 🏷️
- Not affected by AWS downtimes 🔥 [(lol)](https://downdetectordowndetector.com/)

And from my side, the changes are even more impactful.

- Articles are built from text (Markdown) files alike [Obsidian Publish][obsidian-publish] 📜
- Built on open source software[^2] 🔍
- No paid subscription for the software platform used 💸
- No more Notion pages to share stuff around 📚
- Sanity preserved ❤️‍🩹

In the end, we're all winning and I'm motivated again to maintain this website. 🏆

If you wanna do a Hugo website too, I recommend checking out [Christian Lampa's tutorial on Hugo][christianlampa-youtube-hugo] which has been the template for this website. 📺
Of course, feel free to check its source code[^2] and use it as inspiration for your own! ✨
